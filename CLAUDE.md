# Aaron's Portfolio — Retro TV

A portfolio site styled as a vintage CRT television. Every "channel" is one of
Aaron's GitHub projects (github.com/AarKro); channel 1 is the intro program.
Desktop-first, with three device tiers (see "Device tiers" below): desktop gets
the full 3D room, tablet keeps the 3D TV but no room, and phones get a separate
vertical TikTok-style feed.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — dev server
- `npm run build` — typecheck (`tsc -b`) + production build
- `npm run preview` — serve the build

## Stack

React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + SCSS, plus **three.js** (the only other
runtime dependency, used exclusively by the lazy-loaded 3D room). No router,
no state library — keep it that way unless there is a strong reason.

## The one file that matters for content

`src/data/projects.ts` — array of `Project` objects, one per channel, in
broadcast order. **Adding/removing/reordering a project means editing only
this file.** Channel numbers are derived from array position (projects start
at channel 2), so they renumber automatically.

Per project:
- Source is optional: a channel can have `githubUrl` (single repo), `repos`
  (a bundle), or neither — a WIP with nothing public yet (e.g. Tramly) just
  shows the TELETEXT button over the test card. `demoUrl`, `videoUrl` and
  `behindTheScenes` are optional too.
- `githubUrl` (single repo) renders the "VIEW CODE ↗" button.
- `repos` (a `RepoLink[]` of `{ name, url }`) is for a channel that bundles
  several repos under one program (e.g. the Discord bots = Hera + Apollo +
  League Buddy). In place of VIEW CODE it renders one pill the same size as the
  other action buttons, sectioned into a link per repo (dividers between). Set
  `repos` OR `githubUrl`, not both.
- `demoUrl` (optional) is the hosted demo; it becomes the "OPEN DEMO ↗"
  new-tab link (there is no in-screen iframe — demos are never framed).
- `videoUrl` (optional) gives the channel a short teaser clip that autoplays
  (muted, looping) full-bleed as the program backdrop. Import the file
  from `../assets` so Vite bundles + fingerprints it (`import clip from
  '../assets/foo.mp4'; … videoUrl: clip`), don't hand-write a path. Compress
  before adding (see "Adding a teaser clip").
- `behindTheScenes` (optional): one sentence on the interesting technical or
  design decision — written for hiring managers. Must be factually grounded
  in the repo (check its README/package.json), never invented. Shown on the
  teletext page (see below), not on the front bug.
- `description` and `behindTheScenes` support inline `[label](url)` links
  (markdown-style). On the teletext page they render via the `InlineLink`
  component (purple, with a trailing ↗ "leaves the site" glyph); in the SEO
  `.sr-only` block they're flattened to plain `label` text. Used e.g. to link
  WoW Graveyard 3D back to its original 2D repo from inside the text, so the two
  projects share one channel instead of two. Keep links grounded, same as copy.
- **Every project channel shares one "broadcast" layout** (so channels look
  like one consistent building block): a full-bleed *backdrop* — the `videoUrl`
  teaser, or a full-bleed SMPTE test card ("NO LIVE FEED ON THIS CHANNEL") when
  there's none — with a lower-third *bug* over it (title, tech tags, action
  links, and a `▤ TELETEXT` button). The `description` +
  `behindTheScenes` live on a **teletext page** that slides up over the bug when
  TELETEXT is pressed. So those two fields are revealed on demand on *all*
  channels, not shown up front. The teletext page repeats the source/demo links
  in a bottom row that mirrors the bug's action row — same screen position in
  both states, so the links don't jump; only the toggle morphs `▤ TELETEXT` ↔
  `▾ CLOSE TELETEXT`. Teletext has its own colour voice — `$phosphor-purple`
  (the TELETEXT/CLOSE buttons, the teletext header rule, the BEHIND THE SCENES
  label) — to set it apart from the green broadcast UI and the neutral
  external-link buttons.
- Write `description` like a TV program blurb: one short paragraph, a bit of
  personality.

## Adding a teaser clip

Clips live in `src/assets/*.mp4` (imported, bundled, fingerprinted — not in
`public/`). Always compress before committing — raw screen recordings are
huge (the source for Scholar's Mate was 2360×1594 @ 120fps, 9.7 MB; the
shipped clip is 1066×720 @ 30fps, no audio, 1.3 MB). Recipe with ffmpeg:

```
ffmpeg -i raw.mov -vf "scale=-2:720,fps=30" -c:v libx264 -preset slow \
  -crf 28 -profile:v high -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart -an out.mp4
```

`-an` strips audio (clips play muted — see behaviour notes), `+faststart`
lets it start before fully downloaded, 720p is plenty for the small CRT
screen. Drop `crf` toward 30 / `scale` to 540 for an even smaller file.

```

## Device tiers (desktop / tablet / mobile)

`useDeviceTier` classifies the device and `App.tsx` branches on it. Detection is
**capability-first, width-second, and always prefers a precise pointer over
touch**, so a touch-enabled laptop is treated as desktop:

- **desktop** — `(hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` matches (a mouse/trackpad is
  the primary input). The full 3D room, power-off-to-room, hover UI, arrow keys.
  A present touchscreen is purely additive (swipe/buttons still work).
- **tablet** — primary input is coarse/hoverless and width ≥ 768px. Renders the
  **same** `<Scene><TVSet/></Scene>` 3D TV (the camera auto-fits the 920px
  cabinet to any viewport, so no CSS rescale), but the room is disabled (PWR is a
  standby toggle only — App passes no `onPoweredOff` room callback) and the
  WebGLRenderer drops antialias + shadows and runs at pixel-ratio 1.
- **mobile** — coarse/hoverless and width ≤ 767px. Renders `MobileFeed` instead
  of the Scene; **three.js is never instantiated** on phones.

`Scene` takes a `tier` prop (`'desktop' | 'tablet'`); changing tier (e.g.
plugging in a mouse) rebuilds the WebGL context so the new settings apply.

## One scene, one TV (the core architecture)

There is no separate "2D site" — the whole page is a single three.js scene.
The DOM TV (`TVSet`, fully interactive React: buttons, programs) is
placed in 3D space with **CSS3DRenderer** as the front face of the WebGL TV
body. "Website mode" is just the camera parked in front of the TV.

`App.tsx` tracks the camera as a mode machine: `tv → to-room → room → to-tv
→ tv`. Powering off plays the CRT collapse, then the camera pulls back
(seamless — it's literally the same TV). **Pointer lock is requested at the
start of that pull-back** (the PWR click's user activation is still fresh),
so mouselook is already live when the flight lands — no extra click. In the
room: WASD walking, ambient control hints in the lower corners (WASD keycaps
left, mouse glyph right — iconic only, no explainer text by design), ESC
frees the mouse and any click re-locks it; clicking the TV (within 4m,
crosshair turns amber) flies the camera back to the website framing, where
the TV sits in standby (PWR resumes).

Things to know:
- **`Scene.tsx` syncs the 3D world to the DOM** (`syncWorldToDOM`): it
  measures the TVSet element, scales/positions the WebGL body box behind
  the cabinet, and computes the closeup camera framing (cabinet fills
  FIT_HEIGHT/FIT_WIDTH of the viewport). Runs on resize and via a
  ResizeObserver (fonts loading shift the layout). `WORLD_PER_PX` in
  buildRoom.ts maps the 920px cabinet to ~1.1m — if the cabinet's CSS width
  changes, change WORLD_PER_PX with it.
- **TVSet must stay fixed-size** (920px cabinet, no viewport units for its
  width) — apparent size is controlled by camera distance, not CSS.
- TVSet renders into a detached host div via `createPortal`; CSS3DRenderer
  adopts that div. Pointer events on it are enabled only in `tv` mode.
- **`buildRoom.ts` is placeholder geometry by design**, to be swapped for a
  GLTF model later. Outside code relies only on its exports
  ({ tvGroup, tvBody }, BOUNDS, STANDING_SPOT, STAND_TOP_Y, TV_FRONT_Z,
  WORLD_PER_PX, EYE_HEIGHT, CLOSEUP_FOV, WALKING_FOV) — a GLTF version
  must keep that contract. The TV body has no front face: the DOM is the
  front face.
- Camera flights lerp position/quaternion/FOV (CLOSEUP_FOV 55° ↔
  WALKING_FOV 70°); durations at the top of Scene.tsx; the CRT collapse
  handoff is POWER_OFF_DELAY (700ms) in TVSet.tsx.
- three.js is in the main bundle (~200 kB gz total). On desktop/tablet the scene
  IS the page so it can't be lazy-loaded there; phones render `MobileFeed`
  instead and simply never instantiate it (kept in the bundle for simplicity —
  not code-split).
- **Render-on-demand:** the loop only draws when something moves (a camera
  flight, walking, or a `syncWorldToDOM` from resize/reflow). A parked TV — every
  tablet, and an idle desktop — costs ~0 GPU/frame. This is safe because the DOM
  TV's own motion (video, static noise, OSD, teletext slide, phosphor flicker)
  lives in the browser-composited CSS3D layer and keeps animating without a three
  re-render. If you add anything that moves the camera/objects, set
  `needsRender = true` (Scene.tsx) or it won't show.
- Walkable area is clamped to `BOUNDS` (no collision with furniture yet).
- Known CSS3D limitation: the DOM TV ignores WebGL depth, so meshes between
  the camera and the TV won't occlude it (mostly invisible in practice;
  `backface-visibility: hidden` handles viewing from behind).
- **No CSS `border` on rounded elements inside the TV.** Under the CSS3D
  3D transform, Chrome renders border + border-radius with square corner
  artifacts ("little squares" at the corners). Use box-shadow or background
  layers for edge definition instead. (Found by Aaron in devtools, June
  2026 — cabinet/button/antenna borders were removed for this reason.)

Each component lives in its own folder bundling its `.tsx` and `.scss` (same
name as the folder, no barrel `index.ts` files), BEM-style class names,
importing tokens via a relative `@use '../../styles/tokens' as *;`.

## How the TV behaves (don't accidentally break these)

- Channel switching swaps content instantly and covers it with a ~450ms
  static noise burst (real TVs work this way; it also makes rapid button
  mashing safe). Timings live as constants at the top of `useTV.ts`.
- A green `CH 05` OSD shows for 2s after every switch.
- Power off plays a CRT collapse animation (`tv-off` keyframes in
  `Screen.scss`) and disables the channel buttons; power on bursts static.
  After ~2s off, a faint "PRESS PWR TO RESUME BROADCAST" hint fades in, and
  the panel LED turns red (green while on) so the site never looks broken.
- Current channel is mirrored to the URL hash (`#ch-5`), read once on load,
  so channels are shareable links. Deep-linked visitors (initial channel ≠ 1)
  get a one-time hint on screen for ~6s — arrow-keys wording on fine pointers,
  swipe/CH-button wording on touch (`(pointer: coarse)`).
- **Touch:** channels also flip by swiping the glass left/right (`useSwipe` on
  `screen__tube`, `touch-action: pan-y` so vertical teletext scroll still works);
  the CH ▲/▼ buttons remain. Hover styles use the `hover-focus` mixin so they
  never stick after a tap, and tap targets grow to ≈44px under `(pointer:
  coarse)`. The mobile feed is touch-native (vertical scroll-snap).
- `document.title` mirrors the broadcast ("CH 03 · WoW Graveyard 3D — Aaron
  Kromer"; "Standby — …" when off).
- A `videoUrl` channel autoplays its teaser the moment you land on it. The clip
  stays covered by static until the `<video>` fires `playing` (6s safety
  timeout), so there's no black-frame flash. The video is
  `muted loop autoplay playsInline` — muted is mandatory for browsers to allow
  autoplay (and teasers have no audio anyway). Don't drop those attributes.
- The `▤ TELETEXT` button reveals the detailed info. The bug and the teletext
  page are two stacked pages in a `program__deck-track` (200% tall); toggling
  `is-teletext` slides the track up by one page (CSS transform, ~520ms), so the
  bug scrolls up and the teletext page scrolls into view. The CLOSE button uses
  a `▾` glyph because closing slides the page back *down*. Teletext closes on
  that button and resets on channel change.
- There is **no in-screen live demo / iframe** — that feature was removed.
  Demos are external new-tab links only (`demoUrl` → "OPEN DEMO ↗").
- Decorative CRT layers (scanlines/vignette/glare) are `pointer-events: none`
  and sit *above* the program so the teaser still looks like a broadcast.
- The intro channel greets by time of day (morning/afternoon/evening/up-late)
  — `broadcastSlot()` in `IntroProgram.tsx`.

## Conventions

- Keep it simple: no new dependencies for things CSS/canvas can do.
- All colors/fonts come from `src/styles/_tokens.scss` — never hardcode them
  in component styles.
- Fonts: VT323 for everything on the screen, Bungee only for the cabinet
  brand badge. Loaded from Google Fonts in `index.html`.
- `vite.config.ts` uses `base: './'` so the build deploys to any subpath
  (e.g. GitHub Pages) without changes.

## SEO

Aaron shares his name with a well-known American football coach, so the site
is optimized to win **qualified** queries ("aaron kromer developer / frontend
/ portfolio / zürich") and to register as a distinct entity with search
engines — not to outrank ESPN for the bare name.

- `index.html` holds the SEO title ("Aaron Kromer — Frontend Developer &
  Interaction Designer, Zürich"), keyword-rich meta description, canonical
  URL, and two JSON-LD blocks: a `Person` (with `disambiguatingDescription`,
  `sameAs` GitHub/LinkedIn, Zürich address) and a `WebSite`. Keep the runtime
  default `document.title` in `Screen.tsx` in sync with the HTML title.
- `App.tsx` renders an `.sr-only` crawlable section generated from
  `projects.ts` — project channels are only reachable by interaction, which
  crawlers don't do. It must mirror on-screen content only (no extra
  keywords), otherwise it risks being treated as cloaking.
- `public/robots.txt` + `public/sitemap.xml` — bump the sitemap `lastmod`
  on significant content changes.
- A `<noscript>` fallback with name/title/links lives in `index.html`.
- The strongest levers are off-site and belong to Aaron: GitHub profile
  name/bio/website field, LinkedIn website link, repo About-links back to
  the portfolio, and Google Search Console registration.

## Deployment & social previews

- Auto-deploy: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds and publishes to GitHub
  Pages on every push to `main` (Pages source must be set to "GitHub Actions"
  in the repo settings — one-time manual step).
- Canonical URL: https://aarkro.github.io/portfolio/ — hardcoded (absolute,
  as required) in the `og:url` / `og:image` meta tags in `index.html`.
  Update those if the domain ever changes.
- `public/og-image.png` (1200×630) is a screenshot of the intro channel.
  Regenerate after visual changes: build + preview, then capture at 1800×945
  with headless Chrome, center-crop to 1560×819 and resize to 1200×630
  (`sips -c 819 1560 og-image.png && sips -z 630 1200 og-image.png`).
- `public/favicon.svg` is a hand-drawn mini TV matching the site's palette.
